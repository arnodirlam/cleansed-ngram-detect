This script detects languages of strings in a database.
Based on feedbackmine's ruby implementation of the n-gram method.
	https://github.com/feedbackmine/language_detector
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram
	install using the commands:
		gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
		gem install feedbackmine-language_detector
Designed for big amounts of data.
Supports saving results in a new instead of the source table.
Uses activerecord (as used in Ruby on Rails) for general database handling
	gem install activerecord
Uses activerecord-import for inserting multiple values into the database efficiently
	gem install activerecord-import
Tested with ruby 1.8.7
Just adjust the values in CONSTANTS and DATABASE CONNECTION and run the script

I wrote it for a project at university in September 2009.
Just wanted to share it in case anyone can use it.
No further development planned so far.
